A Sketch Plugin to export artboards to a PDF document.

* Export all pages
* Export current page
* Export selected artboards

## Features

| 🔥 | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Artboard Export Order** | Easily set the export order of the artboards when running the plugin. |
| **Export as PNGs into PDF** | This will export each artboard first into a PNG, then place those PNGs together into a single PDF document. This is extremely helpful for things such as 'images with fills', 'gradient fills', 'some shadows' that sometimes don't render well into a PDF.*You can also specify the export size for the PNGs — same as the typical Sketch export; `200w` = width of 200px, `100h` = height of 100px, `3x` = 3 times artboard size* |
| **Ignore Artboards/pages with prefix** | Do you sometimes have those few artboards you still want to keep around, but don't necessarily want to export? Or maybe a page that is an archive? Then this is perfect for you. When checked, you can specify a prefix. Every artboard or page with that prefix will be excluded when exporting. |
| **Include 'Symbol Master' Artboards** | Do you sometimes have those few artboards you still want to keep around, but don't necessarily want to export? Then this is perfect for you. When checked, you can specify a prefix. Every artboard with that prefix will be excluded when exporting. |


## Why make this plugin?

Too often, I found myself going 'File > Export Artboards to PDF', then opening up the PDF and deleting pages I didn't actually want.

Sometimes I would duplicate a page in Sketch as a new iteration on the design. I would then want to export the single iteration—consisting of multiple artboards—into a PDF for distribution and printing purposes; so having a 'Export current page into PDF' option is a real lifesaver!! 😍


## Installation

1. Download the plugin
2. Double-click the file, 'PDF Export.sketchplugin'
